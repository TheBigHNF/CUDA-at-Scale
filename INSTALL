To install the built application, copy the executable to a directory and ensure that there is a directory at the same level named data with sub-directories of source_images, transformed_images, and undone_images. There is an install script which takes the target directory for the executable and creates the data directory and subdirectories. Alternatively, the data directory can be entered on the command line to override the sister data directory lookup.
